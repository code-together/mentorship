# Mentors

Thank you for being a mentor. Here are the guidelines:

- As a mentor you are expected to spend minimum 10 minutes per day or weekly an hour 
- You are free to teach any programming language
- You are free to teach intermediate/advanced topics
- You are free to have more then one mentee
- You are free to change your mentee anytime or exit the program entirely
- You can select a mentee who lives in same city as you and you can have pair programming sessions

## How to join

1. Decide which programming language or topic you want to teach 
2. Check if curriculum already exists in `curriculum` directory
3. If not, come up with your own curriculum. Basic guidelines are outlined [here](curriculum/readme.md)
4. Check [projects](projects.md) and see if already existing projects can be done with the language you are teaching A project `A` in `x` language may be difficult to implement than in `y` language for a beginner, make sure you consider this.
5. If not, come up with your own project

**Note**: If there are no projects and curriculum for your topic/language, then you cannot be added to mentors list.

Send a PR to [this](mentors-list.md) page and add yourself. You should include following info:

- your slack username or your Reddit ID
- programming language you are willing to teach
- availability hours
- location (optional)

We will exclusively use Slack and Github for everything. So you don't need to mention your Reddit ID anywhere. Or you can use an anonymous email for Slack and Github.

## What to teach:

At minimum, you are expected to teach following:

- basics (includes introduction, installing IDE, installing language packages etc)
- variables
- basic data types: String, Integer
- Control statements: if, else
- Looping statements: for
- Functions: function definitions, parameters, function calling, return statement

And a basic project at the end. Suggested projects are mentioned [here](projects.md). If you want to teach some different project, then please send a PR to add your project.

## Teaching materials

Please check the `curriculum` directory. If the language you want to teach is missing, then you have to come up with a plan and submit a PR. Without this, you cannot be added to `mentors-list` page.

## Curriculum

All the curriculum are present in `curriculum` directory. If you want to add a new language, it should have following:

1. A very basic course, which just gives intro to the subject. Interactive courses are better. For example, Code Academy has couple of courses which are intended for beginners.
2. An elaborate course which covers all the topics mentioned in `What to teach`. It is okay if you cannot find #1 for your language of choice, but this #2 is absolutely required since mentee is expected to follow this and learn.
3. A beginner level book for mentee to follow.

You are free to include youtube playlists, udacity/coursera courses etc. 

Apart from programming language, you can also teach other topics like `algorithms`, `linux` etc. However you must come up with a curriculum.

## How to teach

The first session to mentee should give them a basic intro. Once it is done, mentee will start learning on their own following the curriculum. You are expected help the mentee whenever they are stuck. 

Whenever required and is appropriate, you should also teach mentee how to Google, [how to ask questions online](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), how to make most of subreddits like /r/learnprogramming and how to use Stackoverflow.

Once they have learnt the basics, guide them through the project. 

Remember, you are not expected to spend more than hour per week. Mentee should do everything, you should only help when they are stuck.
