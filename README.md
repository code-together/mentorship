# mentorship

These are the docs for the mentorship programme for developers being run currently
on the [r/india](https://reddit.com/r/india) subreddit.

We have the following docs available:

- [Mentor's Guide](mentors-guide.md)
- [Mentor List](mentors-list.md)
- [Application Guide](apply.md)
- [Suggested Projects](projects.md)

# Idea

This project grew out of the r/india's Weekly Coders & Hackers
thread. A lot of people were interested in learning programming
in those threads and this project is the result.
