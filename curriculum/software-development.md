# Software Development

**Mentor**: [nemo](mentors-list.md)

**Note**: This is an experimental course based on a book that is still being written.

The idea is to make intermediate developers better at development by helping them
understand Software Development as it is practiced in the industry.

This is not a course for learning programming. The book I'll follow is [The Joy
of Software Development][josd] (*Disclaimer*: I'm currently working on the book).

# Things I plan to cover

- [Automated Testing](https://josd.captnemo.in/content/tdd.html)
- Continuous Integration
- [Setting up a development environment](https://josd.captnemo.in/content/setup.html)
- Agnostic and Cross Platform Development
- Coding Style Guides
- Best Practices
- Unix
- [Software Security](https://josd.captnemo.in/content/security.html)

And other topics from the book as well.
