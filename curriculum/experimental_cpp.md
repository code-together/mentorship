### Course Intro
This is an experimental course for introducing modern C++ based on a book/tutorial that I'm working. The course/tutorial is aimed at people with some exposure to programming concepts. Knowledege of C is not required to start with this tutorial. However, absolute beginners may face problems following along.

The course intends to emphasize and introduce modern C++ practices and idioms over the traditional method of teaching C++, which involved introducing basic concepts of C first and building on top of this foundation to introduce C++.
