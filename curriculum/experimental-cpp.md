# Modern C++ (Experimental)

**Mentor(s)**: [frag-o-matic](../mentors-list.md)

## Course Intro
This is an experimental course for introducing modern C++ based on a book/tutorial that I'm working. The course/tutorial is aimed at people with some exposure to programming concepts. Knowledege of C is not required to start with this tutorial. However, absolute beginners may face problems following along.

The course intends to emphasize and introduce modern C++ practices and idioms over the traditional method of teaching C++, which involved introducing basic concepts of C first and building on top of this foundation to introduce C++.

## Table of Contents

Topics and order in which they will be covered is documented [here](https://github.com/frag-o-matic/cpptutorial/blob/master/README.md)

Speaking in broad terms, following aspects of the language will be covered:
* Basic Language Features: With strong emphasis on new language features and idioms
	- `auto`, range-based `for` and lambda functions
	- Memory and Resource Safety, RAII and `unique_ptr`/`shared_ptr`
* Features for facilitating Object Oriented Programming
	- `override` and `final`
* Standard Library Features: Common Containers & Algorithms
	- `vector`s, `string`s and `map`
	- `find`, `count`, `sort` and `remove` along with the predicated versions
* Overview of the older features of the Language: The `C` in `C++`
