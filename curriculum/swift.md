# Swift

Mentor(s) : [codeOfRobin](https://github.com/codeOfRobin)

Hey there ðŸ‘‹!! If you're here, you probably wanna learn Swift(shocker!) . It's a really cool general purpose programming language built by ï£¿ for their platforms (iOS, MacOS, tvOS, watchOS) and has been ported onto platforms like Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi and Windows.

## Prerequisites

None really. 

> Wait, don't I need a Mac?

Not really. A mac would be _nice_ (they are, after all, the best computers available), but these work too

* Ubuntu 14.04 or Ubuntu 15.10. Refer to swift.org for download instructions.
* An iPad with Swift playgrounds.
* I've setup a raspberry pi with swift 2.2 in my room. Not really the best way, but it works Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
